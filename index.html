        Skateboarding began in the 1950s and quickly became associated with Southern California’s surf-culture. All of the skateboarding in these early years was on streets, sidewalks, paths and plazas. Skateboards made from repurposed roller skates was a national craze in the 1950s. By the 1960s, companies were manufacturing skateboards. In the 1970s the use of urethane wheels allowed skating on rougher terrain and helped skateboarding gain a fresh wave of national popularity. This era introduced us to the first parks built specifically for skateboarding.

      <p class ="size">
        These early skateparks featured concrete shaped into round bumps, channels, and bowls that vaguely resembled empty swimming pools and moguls. Around the same time, wooden halfpipes were cropping up on television and in backyards, allowing spectators to better see the activity. Skateboarding’s popularity peaked.

        Those first-generation skateparks were almost all retail businesses. To use them you had pay an entrance fee or needed some kind of membership. Nearly all of the skateparks from the 1970s era are gone today. By the end of the ‘70s, laws about liability were changed and insurance companies became nervous about these parks. Most skateparks had slim profit margins to begin with, but when insurance rates exploded, the small businesses went under.

      <p class ="size">
        By 2000 skateparks were being promoted and built across the nation. Advocates were getting more effective, and the skateparks started getting bigger and better. Communities began to understand that some skateparks perform better than others. Concrete skateparks became more popular than wood or steel. Skateparks began to be built downtown, near where people lived and worked, rather than in the outskirts of town, away from everything. Lots of lessons were learned

    	BEND YOUR KNEES
		A low, relaxed stance is helpful for all skateboarding tricks because it gives you the ability to immediately adjust your balance in any situation.
		</li>

		<li class = "size">
		BE DETERMINED
		Practice and dedication is the best trick for learning to skate and most other things in life. Skateboarding is hard, don’t expect to be good right away. Its difficulty is part of what makes skateboarding so gratifying and brings people back day after day.
		</li>

		<li class = "size">
		 BE READY TO FALL
		 Falling is an unavoidable part of skateboarding. We recommend investing in a helmet and protective gear that will help keep you healthy so you can keep skating and falling for life!.
		</li>

		<li class = "size">
		USE QUALITY EQUIPMENT
		Skateboards from department stores tend to have poor quality parts and won't perform as well as boards from actual skate companies, which can be frustrating and make them discouraging to ride. We stock a large selection of quality gear from all the top skate brands.
		</li>

		<li class = "size">
		BE CONFIDENT
		Don’t worry about how you look or how good you are. If you're skating hard, trying new tricks and being mindful of others, you will earn respect from your fellow skaters. No matter how basic the trick, all skateboarders love to see another skater push their limits and progress their skills.
